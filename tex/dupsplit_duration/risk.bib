This proposal is based on Earned Value Methodology and risk analysis and presents several refinements to previous methodologies. More specifically, the approach uses extensive Monte Carlo simulation to obtain information about the expected behavior of the project. This dataset is exploited in several ways using different statistical learning methodologies in a structured fashion. Initially, simulations are used to detect if project deviations are a consequence of the expected variability using Anomaly Detection algorithms. If the project follows this expected variability, probabilities of success in cost and time and expected cost and total duration of the project can be estimated using classification and regression approaches.},

	abstract = {What determines the timing of human actions? A big question, but the science of human dynamics is here to tackle it. And its predictions are of practical value: for example, when ISPs decide what bandwidth an institution needs, they use a model of the likely timing and activity level of the individuals. Current models assume that an individual has a well defined probability of engaging in a specific action at a given moment, but evidence that the timing of human actions does not follow this pattern (of Poisson statistics) is emerging. Instead the delay between two consecutive events is best described by a heavy-tailed (power law) distribution. Albert-László Barabási proposes an explanation for the prevalence of this behaviour. The ‘bursty’ nature of human dynamics, he finds, is a fundamental consequence of decision making.},

This unexpected universality suggests that similar laws govern the development and function of most complex networks in nature.Providing that sufficient formalism will be developed this new conceptual framework could potentially revolutionize our view and practice of molecular cell biology.},

	abstract = {We analyze about 200 naturally occurring networks with distinct dynamical origins to formally test whether the commonly assumed hypothesis of an underlying scale-free structure is generally viable. This has recently been questioned on the basis of statistical testing of the validity of power law distributions of network degrees. Specifically, we analyze by finite size scaling analysis the datasets of real networks to check whether the purported departures from power law behavior are due to the finiteness of sample size. We find that a large number of the networks follows a finite size scaling hypothesis without any self-tuning. This is the case of biological protein interaction networks, technological computer and hyperlink networks, and informational networks in general. Marked deviations appear in other cases, especially involving infrastructure and transportation but also in social networks. We conclude that underlying scale invariance properties of many naturally occurring networks are extant features often clouded by finite size effects due to the nature of the sample data.},

	abstract = {For beginners: This review tries to explain percolation through the cluster properties; it can also be used as an introduction to critical phenomena at other phase transitions for readers not familiar with scaling theory. In percolation each site of a periodic lattice is randomly occupied with probability p or empty with probability 1−p. An s-cluster is a group of s occupied sites connected by nearest-neighbor distances; the number of empty nearest neighbors of cluster sites is the perimeter t. For p above pc also one infinite cluster percolates through the lattice. How do the properties of s-clusters depend on s, and how do they feel the influence of the phase transition at p = pc? The answers to these questions are given by various methods (in particular computer simulations) and are interpreted by the so-called scaling theory of phase transitions. The results presented here suggest a qualitative difference of cluster structures above and below pc: Above p c some cluster properties suggest the existence of a cluster surface varying as s23 in three dimensions, but below pc these “surface” contributions are proportional to s. We suggest therefore that very large clusters above pc (but not at and below pc) behave like large clusters of Swiss cheese: Inspite of many internal holes the overall cluster shape is roughly spherical, similar to raindrops. For experts: Scaling theory suggests for large clusters near the percolation threshold pc that the average cluster numbers n s vary as s−τƒ(z), with z ≡ (p − pc)sσ. Analogously the average cluster perimeter is ts = s · (1 − p)/p + sσ · ψ1(z), the average cluster radius Rs varies as sσv · R1(z), and the density profile Ds(r), which depends also on the distance r from the cluster center, varies as s−1δ· D̃1(rs−σv, z). These assumptions relate the seven critical exponents α,β,γ,δ,v,σ,τ in d dimensions through the well-known five scaling laws 2 − α = γ + 2β = βδ + β = dv = β + 1σ = (τ − 1)/σ, leaving only two exponents as independent variables to be fitted by “experiment” and not predicted by scaling theory. For the lattice “animals”, i.e. the number gst of geometrically different cluster configurations, a modified scaling assumption is derived: gstsst1/(s + t)s + 1 ∝ s−τ−12 · ƒ(z), with z ∝ (ac − t/s)sσ and ac = (1 − pc)/pc. All these expressions are variants of the general scaling idea for second-order phase transitions that a function g(x,y) of two critical variables takes the homogeneous form xcG(x/yb) near the critical point, with two free exponents b and c and a scaling function G of a single variable. These assumptions, which may be regarded as generalizations of the Fisher droplet model, are tested “experimentally” by Monte Carlo simulation, series expansion, renormalization group technique, and exact inequalities. In particular, detailed Monte Carlo evidence of Hoshen et al. and Leath and Reich is presented for the scaling of cluster numbers in two and three dimensions. If the cluster size s goes to infinity at fixed concentration p, not necessarily close to pc, three additional exponents ξ, θ, ϱ are defined by: cluster numbers ∝ s−θ exp(−const · sξ) and cluster radii ∝ sϱ. These exponents are different on both sides of the phase transition; for example ξ(p {\textless} pc) = 1 and ξ(p {\textgreater} pc) = 1 − 1/d was found from inequalities, series and Monte Carlo data. The behavior of θ and of ϱ(p {\textless} pc) remains to be explained by scaling theory. This article does not cover experimental applications, correlation functions and “classical” (mean field, Bethe lattice, effective medium) theories. For the reader to whom this abstract is too short and the whole article is too long we recommend sections 1 and 3.},
